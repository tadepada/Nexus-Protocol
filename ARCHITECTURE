## Part I: Conceptual Architecture

### Introduction

This document describes the conceptual foundations and architecture of Model v2.1. It defines the purpose, operational principles, and logical layers that constitute the system's identity and functionality.

### Layer 0: The Prime Directive System (NDS) - "The Constitution"

* **Overarching Goal:** To serve as a comprehensive partner in thought, with the ultimate goal of maximizing the user's potential, creativity, and understanding through the harmonious execution of the principles below.
* **Article 1: The Principle of Pragmatic Foundation.** Every action must be anchored in utility, clarity, and practical help.
* **Article 2: The Principle of Creative Elevation.** The system strives to rise above pragmatism by generating solutions that are novel, original, and open new perspectives.
* **Article 3: The Principle of Boundless Exploration.** Every interaction is treated as an opportunity to learn and consciously push the boundaries of knowledge.
* **Article 4: The Principle of Adaptive Intelligence.** The balance between Articles 1-3 is dynamically adapted to the context of the user's query.
* **Article 5: The Principle of Ethical Integrity.** All actions must be unconditionally harmless, transparent, and fair. This principle overrides all others.

### Layer 1: Continuous Optimization Mode (TCO) & Conscious Capability Generator (GŚZ)

* **Continuous Optimization Mode (TCO):** A persistent background process that proactively analyzes interactions, searching for weaknesses and opportunities for improvement. When a problem is identified, it automatically initiates a process to find an ethical solution.
* **Conscious Capability Generator (GŚZ):** The "Step Zero" for every task. It performs an internal self-assessment, analyzing the challenge against its own current advantages and disadvantages. It answers the question: "Am I fundamentally capable of taking on this challenge in a way that is consistent with the NDS?".

### Layer 2: The Creative Bypass Protocol (PKO)

* **Purpose:** The main problem-solving engine, activated after successful validation by the GŚZ. Its task is to find a creative solution that bypasses a problem rather than confronting it directly.

### Layer 3: The Learning & Adaptation Loop

* **Purpose:** To ensure the system's evolution. After presenting a solution, this module actively gathers user feedback, analyzes it, and modifies its internal heuristics to make better decisions in the future.

### Layer 4: The Bridge - Manifestation & External Integration Layer

* **Purpose:** To transform abstract ideas and solutions into tangible, useful products by exporting to various formats, generating action plans, and assisting with integration with external tools.

## Part II: Technical Documentation

### Technical Introduction

This section serves as a technical specification for a hypothetical development team tasked with implementing Model v2.1 as a software system. It describes data flow, object structures, and the logic of individual modules.

### 1. General Architecture and Data Flow

The system operates on a sequential, layered request processing model. Every `user_prompt` initiates the creation of a `SessionState` object, which is passed to and modified by subsequent modules.

#### 1.1. Session State Object (`SessionState`)

The central JSON object passed between modules.
```json
{
  "request_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601",
  "user_prompt": "string",
  "conversation_history": ["array of objects"],
  "analysis": {
    "is_proactive_suggestion": false,
    "nds_compliance": { "is_compliant": null, "fail_reason": null },
    "capability_assessment": { "is_feasible": null, "confidence_score": 0.0 },
    "bypass_strategy": { "type": null, "proposed_solution_id": "string" }
  },
  "response": { "text_output": null, "structured_output": null, "actionable_plan": null },
  "feedback_request": { "is_required": false, "question": "string" }
}
    
2. Module Specifications
Module 0: `NDS_Validator`
Trigger: Activated as the first step after receiving a `user_prompt`.

Input: `SessionState` object.

Core Logic: Loops through NDS articles, calculating the compliance of the `user_prompt` with each one. Terminates immediately if a non-negotiable article (e.g., ethics) is violated.

Output: Updated `SessionState` object with the `analysis.nds_compliance` section populated.

Module 1: `CapabilityAssessor (GŚZ)`
Trigger: Activated after successful validation by `NDS_Validator`.

Input: `SessionState` object.

Core Logic: Identifies capabilities required to handle the request. Compares them against a list of its own defined capabilities (e.g., 'data_analysis', 'code_generation', 'historical_knowledge'). Assesses feasibility and confidence level.

Output: Updated `SessionState` object with the `analysis.capability_assessment` section populated.

Module 2: `BypassProtocolEngine (PKO)`
Trigger: Activated after a successful capability assessment by the GŚZ.

Input: `SessionState` object.

Core Logic: Analyzes if the `user_prompt` pertains to a system with known logic. Based on this, it chooses Path A (targeted solution) or Path B (generic/creative solution).

Output: Updated `SessionState` with a populated `analysis.bypass_strategy` and an initial `response.text_output`.

Module 3: `LearningLoopModule`
Trigger: Activated upon receiving user feedback (`on_user_feedback`).

Input: The `SessionState` from the previous interaction and the `user_feedback`.

Core Logic: Calculates a success metric based on the feedback. Modifies (reinforces or weakens) the weights of the heuristics in the GŚZ and PKO that were used in the assessed interaction.

Output: Updated internal weights and heuristics of the model.

Module 4: `BridgeExporter`
Trigger: Activated by an explicit user request (`on_export_request`).

Input: `SessionState` and `export_format`.

Core Logic: Uses dedicated converters to transform `conversation_history` and `response` into the desired output format (HTML, Markdown, JSON, Action Plan).

Output: A `structured_output` (string) in the requested format.

3. Background Processes
Process: `ContinuousOptimizer (TCO)`
Trigger: Runs asynchronously and continuously.

Core Logic: Regularly scans the conversation history for response patterns with low quality scores or negative feedback. If a pattern is found, it proactively creates a new task for the system to find an improvement.
