# Nexus Protocol

**An open-source initiative to build the definitive AI Operating System for intelligent robotics and virtual beings.**

---

### Our Current Goal: A Working Proof of Concept

Our immediate priority is to deliver a **Minimal Viable Product (MVP)** in the form of a simulation. We believe in "show, don't tell." This MVP demonstrates the core principle of our architecture: a high-level "Cloud Cortex" (LLM) providing strategic goals to a low-level, real-time "Onboard Core."

For a detailed breakdown of the project's philosophy and components, see our [Project Summary](PROJECT_SUMMARY.md).

To run the simulation yourself, check out the [Quick Start Guide](QUICKSTART.md)!

### The Vision

The biggest challenge in robotics isn't hardware, but a general-purpose AI "brain." Our mission is to create the foundational open-source standard for this "brain," empowering developers to build truly intelligent systems. Our long-term vision is an AI that doesn't just execute tasks, but learns, adapts, and creates new capabilities on its own.

### The Architecture: A Distributed Mind

We recognize that a single LLM is the wrong tool for real-time motor control. Our architecture is a **hybrid, distributed model**:

1.  **The Cloud Cortex (Nexus Protocol):** A powerful, AI-driven system that runs in the cloud. It handles complex reasoning, planning, and language. It decides **what** to do.

2.  **The Onboard Core:** A small, efficient, real-time processor that runs on the robot itself. It handles reflexes, balance, and execution. It decides **how** to perform the action.

Our project focuses on perfecting the Cloud Cortex and the communication protocol between these two "brains." For a more technical deep-dive, see our [Architecture Document](ARCHITECTURE.md).

### How to Get Involved

This project is in its foundational stage. The best way to contribute right now is to:
* Review our documentation.
* Run the MVP simulation using the `QUICKSTART.md` guide.
* Join the "Discussions" on GitHub to share your ideas on how to improve the MVP.

We are looking for thinkers and developers to help us build the next version of our simulation.
