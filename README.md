> **Project Update (July 18, 2025):** The project has undergone a significant strategic pivot based on early feedback. We have just finalized our first functional MVP (a Python simulation) and have updated all documentation to reflect a new, more focused, and ambitious long-term vision. We are officially ready for community engagement!

# Nexus Protocol

**An open-source architecture for building resilient, self-monitoring, and continuously evolving autonomous agents.**

### The Problem

Standard autonomous agents are static. They operate on a fixed set of rules and fail when encountering novel situations. They don't learn from their mistakes in a meaningful way, and their core logic doesn't improve over time.

### Our Solution: An Evolutionary Architecture

Nexus Protocol is a blueprint for an AI that learns, adapts, and evolves. Our core principle is that a true general intelligence cannot be programmed; it must emerge from a continuous cycle of interaction, self-reflection, and self-improvement.

Our first **Minimal Viable Product (MVP)** is a simple Python simulation demonstrating the foundational concept: an agent that can monitor its own actions and detect its own failures. This "Awareness Loop" is the first step on the road to a self-evolving system.

### Getting Started

* **Run the MVP:** See our core idea in action in under 60 seconds. Go to our **[Quick Start Guide](QUICKSTART.md)**.
* **Read the Vision:** Understand our ambitious, long-term goal. Read our **[Project Summary](PROJECT_SUMMARY.md)**.
* **Explore the Architecture:** Dive deep into the full technical and philosophical vision. See our **[Architecture Document](ARCHITECTURE.md)**.
* **Get Involved:** Have an idea? Join the **[Discussions](https://github.com/tadepada/Nexus-Protocol/discussions)** tab.

We are at day zero of an ambitious journey. We are looking for thinkers, developers, and visionaries to help us build the next generation of AI.
