# Nexus Protocol

**An open-source initiative to build the definitive AI Operating System for intelligent robotics and virtual beings.**

---

### Our Current Goal: A Working Proof of Concept

Our immediate priority is to deliver a **Minimal Viable Product (MVP)** in the form of a simulation. We believe in "show, don't tell." This MVP will demonstrate the core principle of our architecture: a high-level "Cloud Cortex" (LLM) providing strategic goals to a low-level, real-time "Onboard Core."

Check our `ROADMAP.md` for details on the MVP.

### The Vision

The biggest challenge in robotics isn't hardware, but a general-purpose AI "brain." Our mission is to create the foundational open-source standard for this "brain," empowering developers to build truly intelligent systems.

### The Architecture: A Distributed Mind

We recognize that a single LLM is the wrong tool for real-time motor control. Our architecture is a **hybrid, distributed model**:

1.  **The Cloud Cortex (Nexus Protocol):** A powerful, LLM-based model (like the one we are defining) runs in the cloud. It handles complex reasoning, planning, and language. It decides **what** to do (e.g., "get the water bottle from the table").

2.  **The Onboard Core:** A small, efficient, real-time processor runs on the robot itself. It handles reflexes, balance, and execution. It decides **how** to perform the action (e.g., calculating the precise joint movements to grab the bottle).

Our project focuses on perfecting the Cloud Cortex and the communication protocol between these two "brains."

### How to Get Involved

This project is in its foundational stage. The best way to contribute right now is to:
* Review our `ARCHITECTURE.md` and the MVP specification in our `ROADMAP.md`.
* Join the "Discussions" on GitHub to share your ideas on the best way to build this MVP.
* Help us refine the technical specifications before we start coding.

We are looking for thinkers and developers to help us build this first, crucial proof of concept.
