# Nexus Protocol

**An open-source architecture for building resilient, self-monitoring autonomous agents.**

---

### The Problem

Standard autonomous agents often operate in a simple "plan-and-execute" loop. They are brittle and tend to fail silently. When an action doesn't produce the expected result (e.g., a gripper slips), the system often continues with its plan, leading to compounded errors, or it simply freezes, unable to recover.

### Our Solution: The Awareness Loop

Nexus Protocol introduces a simple but powerful architectural pattern: **The Awareness Loop**. Instead of just planning and executing, our agents operate in a **Plan -> Execute -> Verify** cycle.

The core of our MVP is a simulation of three key components:
1.  **A `CloudCortex` (Planner):** A high-level module that creates a strategic plan to achieve a goal.
2.  **An `OnboardCore` (Executor):** A low-level module that executes each step of the plan in the environment.
3.  **An `AwarenessMonitor` (Verifier):** A crucial third component that observes the outcome of each action and compares it to the expected outcome defined by the plan.

This constant verification loop gives the agent a primitive form of "operational awareness." It is the fundamental building block for creating systems that can detect their own errors.

### The MVP

This repository contains a working **Minimal Viable Product (MVP)** (`main.py`), a Python script that simulates this entire process. You can run it and see the `AwarenessMonitor` successfully detect both successful actions and simulated physical failures.

See our **[Quick Start Guide](QUICKSTART.md)** to run the simulation in under a minute.

### The Roadmap

Our vision is to build upon this foundation. The next logical steps are:
* **Implement Autonomous Recovery:** Create protocols that allow the agent to generate new plans in response to anomalies detected by the `AwarenessMonitor`.
* **Integrate a Real LLM:** Replace the current simulated planner with a true Large Language Model (like the Gemini API) to handle more complex, natural language goals.
* **Bridge to Robotics:** Integrate the architecture with ROS 2 to control a simulated or physical robot.

Check our full **[Roadmap](ROADMAP.md)** for more details.

### How to Get Involved

This is a foundational project focused on solving a core problem in reliable AI. We are looking for collaborators to help us improve this MVP and design our autonomous recovery protocols. Please join the **Discussions** on GitHub.
