# Contributing to Nexus Protocol

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing! We are building an ambitious project, and every contribution, no matter how small, is incredibly valuable.

This project is not just about code. We welcome and need a diverse range of skills.

## How You Can Contribute

* **Discuss Ideas:** The best place to start is our "Discussions" tab on GitHub. Share your thoughts on the architecture, propose new ideas, or ask questions.
* **Improve Documentation:** If you see a typo or have an idea to make our documentation clearer, please let us know!
* **Report Issues:** If you find a flaw in our logic or a bug in our future code, opening an "Issue" is the best way to report it.
* **Write Code:** Once we have our initial codebase, we will be looking for developers to help build out new features and modules.
