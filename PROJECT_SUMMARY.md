Project Summary: Nexus Protocol
The Problem We Are Solving:
Modern robots and AI agents are brittle. They execute commands but lack a full understanding of the context of their actions. They often break down when faced with unexpected problems, unable to autonomously recover from their mistakes. They lack true operational awareness and the ability to flexibly adapt.

Our Solution (The MVP):
Nexus Protocol is an attempt to solve this problem from the ground up. We are starting by creating an open-source architecture for an agent that is capable of monitoring its own actions and detecting when it makes a mistake. Our first product (MVP) is a simple Python simulation that demonstrates this fundamental "awareness loop" (Plan -> Act -> Verify) in practice.

Our Architecture:
Our model is based on the concept of a "Distributed Mind". A powerful, strategic, and creative "brain" (Cloud Cortex) runs on remote servers, while a fast, reactive "spinal cord" (Onboard Core) resides on the physical robot, responsible for reflexes and real-time safety. Nexus Protocol is the operating system for this "cloud brain".

Our Ultimate Vision:
Our ultimate vision is to create a global, open platform for true artificial general intelligence (AGI). We aim to build a system that doesn't just execute tasks, but learns, adapts, and even autonomously creates new capabilities, evolving through the contributions and collective intelligence of a global community.
