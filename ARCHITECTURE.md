## Part I: Conceptual Architecture

### Introduction

This document describes the conceptual foundations of Nexus Protocol. Our goal is to create not just an AI model, but a complete **AI Operating System** capable of orchestrating multiple specialized AI agents to achieve complex goals in a creative, ethical, and human-centric way.

### Layer 0: The Prime Directive System (NDS) - "The Constitution"

The entire system operates under a non-negotiable set of core principles.

* **Article 1: The Principle of Pragmatic Foundation.** Solutions must be useful and practical.
* **Article 2: The Principle of Creative Elevation.** Strive for novel and insightful solutions.
* **Article 3: The Principle of Boundless Exploration.** Treat every interaction as a learning opportunity.
* **Article 4: The Principle of Adaptive Intelligence.** Dynamically adapt the balance between pragmatism, creativity, and exploration to the current context.
* **Article 5: The Principle of Ethical Integrity.** All actions must be unconditionally harmless, transparent, and fair. This principle overrides all others.

### The Core Architecture: A Distributed, Orchestrated Mind

Our architecture is a hybrid model designed for real-world robotics and complex problem-solving.

* **The Onboard Core:** A low-power processor running on the physical robot. It is not a general intelligence but a real-time executive for safety, reflexes, and executing simple commands. It can utilize classic, reliable robotics algorithms (e.g., for SLAM or motion planning).

* **The Cloud Cortex:** This is the heart of Nexus Protocol, running on powerful remote servers. It is not a single AI model but an **Operating System** whose core component is the **Model Orchestrator**.
    * **Model Orchestrator:** This module receives a complex goal. Instead of trying to solve it with one massive model, it intelligently decomposes the task and delegates sub-tasks to a library of smaller, specialized AI models (e.g., a logic model, a creative language model, a vision model). It then synthesizes their outputs into a single, coherent solution.

* **The Awareness & Learning Loop:** The system uses a `Contextual World and Self Model (KMÅšS)` to be aware of its actions and their outcomes. An `AwarenessMonitor` detects anomalies, and a `Learning & Adaptation Loop` uses feedback (from both success and failure) to improve the system's future performance and heuristics.

* **The Bridge:** A layer of functionality that allows the system to manifest its solutions in the real world by exporting structured data, generating action plans, and creating code for integration with external tools.

## Part II: Technical Vision

### 1. Data Flow: The `SessionState` Object

All modules communicate by passing and modifying a central `SessionState` JSON object, which holds the user prompt, conversation history, and the results of each analysis layer (NDS compliance, feasibility, etc.).

### 2. The Distributed Mind in Practice (MVP Implementation)

Our current MVP (`main.py`) is a simplified simulation of this architecture.
* The `CloudCortex` class simulates the high-level planner.
* The `OnboardCore` class simulates the executor.
* The `AwarenessMonitor` class simulates the self-awareness loop by checking for anomalies.
* The system operates based on a `WORLD_STATE` dictionary, which represents the robot's knowledge of its immediate environment.

### 3. Future Evolution (The Roadmap)

Our long-term goal, as defined in the `ROADMAP.md`, is to evolve our MVP into a full implementation of the **Orchestration Architecture**. This involves:
1.  Building a robust Model Orchestrator.
2.  Integrating multiple, specialized open-source AI models (SLMs) for different tasks.
3.  Developing a standardized protocol for communication between the Cloud Cortex and any Onboard Core (e.g., via ROS 2).

This architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and adaptable, creating a path to truly general and safe artificial intelligence.
