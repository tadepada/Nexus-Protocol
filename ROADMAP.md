# Nexus Protocol Roadmap

This document outlines the evolutionary path for Nexus Protocol. Each phase is a foundation for the next, moving from a simple MVP to a fully autonomous, self-evolving system.

## Phase 1: MVP Launch & Community Building (Current Focus)

* **Goal:** Publicly launch our functional MVP to attract the first contributors and gather real-world feedback to fuel our learning loop.
* **Key Results:**
    * [x] **MVP v1.0 code is complete and tested.**
    * [ ] **Update the GitHub repository with all final files.**
    * [ ] **Launch publicly on Hacker News, Reddit, etc.**

## Phase 2: The Orchestrator - Towards v2.0

* **Goal:** Evolve the MVP into a true AI Operating System by implementing the "Orchestration Architecture".
* **Key Results:**
    * [ ] Implement the `Model Orchestrator` to manage and delegate tasks to multiple, specialized AI models.
    * [ ] Refine the `Onboard Core` interface to work with classic robotics algorithms (e.g., via ROS 2).

## The Infinite Loop: The Vision of a Self-Improving Mind (v3.0 and beyond)

* **Goal:** Implement the core protocols for true AGI, turning the system into a continuously learning and evolving entity.
* **This is not a final phase, but an ongoing process of:**
    * **Deepening Perception:** Integrating advanced, multi-modal sensory analysis.
    * **Achieving True Autonomy:** Implementing the `Existential Goal Generators`.
    * **Enabling Self-Creation:** Implementing the `Autocreation Loop`.
