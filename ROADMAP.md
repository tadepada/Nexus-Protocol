# Nexus Protocol Roadmap

This document outlines our strategic goals. Our immediate focus is on launching our working MVP and building a community around it.

## Phase 1: MVP Launch & Community Building (Current Focus)

* **Goal:** Publicly launch our functional MVP to attract the first contributors and gather real-world feedback.
* **Key Results:**
    * [x] **MVP v1.0 code is complete and tested.**
    * [ ] **Update the GitHub repository with all final files.**
    * [ ] **Launch publicly on Hacker News, Reddit, etc.**
    * [ ] Attract the first 10 active community members.
    * [ ] Gather feedback to create a backlog for the next version.

## Phase 2: The Orchestrator - Implementing Model v2.3 (Next Major Goal)

* **Goal:** Evolve Nexus Protocol from a simple planner into a true AI Operating System by implementing the "Orchestration Architecture".
* **Key Results:**
    * [ ] Design the detailed specification for the "Model Orchestrator" component.
    * [ ] Implement the ability for the Cloud Cortex to manage and delegate tasks to multiple, specialized AI models (SLMs).
    * [ ] Refine the Onboard Core interface to work with classic robotics algorithms.

## Phase 3: The Robotic Bridge (Long-Term Goal)

* **Goal:** Create the first successful integration with a physical or simulated robotics platform using the full v2.3 architecture.
* **Key Results:**
    * [ ] Develop a stable bridge to ROS 2.
    * [ ] Demonstrate the full orchestration pipeline controlling a virtual robot.
