# Nexus Protocol Roadmap

This document outlines our strategic goals. Our immediate focus is on delivering a tangible Proof of Concept to validate our core architecture.

## Phase 1: Foundation & MVP (Current Focus)

* **Goal:** Deliver a functional, simulated Proof of Concept (Minimal Viable Product) and establish the project's core identity.
* **Key Results:**
    * [x] Finalize the project name: **Nexus Protocol**.
    * [x] Create and publish the initial documentation.
    * [x] **Develop and release the MVP Simulation v0.4 (`main.py`)**.
    * [ ] Publish a technical blog post explaining the MVP and our architecture.
    * [ ] Attract the first 10 community members/contributors by sharing our working MVP.

## Phase 2: Community & Enhancement (Post-MVP)

* **Goal:** Build a community around our working MVP and enhance its capabilities based on feedback.
* **Key Results:**
    * [ ] Refine the MVP simulation with more complex scenarios, objects, and actions.
    * [ ] Improve the core `Model v2.2` architecture based on community feedback.
    * [ ] Create a more visual representation of the simulation (e.g., using a simple 2D library).

## Phase 3: The Robotic Bridge (Long-Term Goal)

* **Goal:** Create the first successful integration with a robotics platform.
* **Key Results:**
    * [ ] Develop a bridge to connect Nexus Protocol with **ROS (Robot Operating System)**.
    * [ ] Run a successful simulation of the AI controlling a virtual robot in a standardized environment (e.g., Gazebo).
