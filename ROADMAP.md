# Nexus Protocol Roadmap

This document outlines our strategic goals, from the immediate MVP launch to our long-term vision of a self-evolving AI.

## Phase 1: MVP Launch & Community Building (Current Focus)

* **Goal:** Publicly launch our functional MVP to attract the first contributors and gather real-world feedback.
* **Key Results:**
    * [x] **MVP v1.0 code is complete and tested.**
    * [ ] **Update the GitHub repository with all final files.**
    * [ ] **Launch publicly on Hacker News, Reddit, etc.**
    * [ ] Attract the first 10 active community members.
    * [ ] Gather feedback to create a backlog for the next version.

## Phase 2: The Orchestrator - Implementing Model v2.3

* **Goal:** Evolve Nexus Protocol from a simple planner into a true AI Operating System by implementing the "Orchestration Architecture".
* **Key Results:**
    * [ ] Design the detailed specification for the "Model Orchestrator" component.
    * [ ] Implement the ability for the Cloud Cortex to manage and delegate tasks to multiple, specialized AI models (SLMs).
    * [ ] Refine the Onboard Core interface to work with classic robotics algorithms.

## Phase 3: The Robotic Bridge

* **Goal:** Create the first successful integration with a physical or simulated robotics platform (e.g., via ROS 2).

## Phase 4: The Ultimate Goal - Evolutionary Intelligence (Model v5.0)

* **Goal:** Implement the **Autocreation Loop**, creating a system that can autonomously generate new capabilities based on its own creative synthesis.
* **Key Results:**
    * [ ] Develop a framework for deconstructing abstract ideas into reusable components.
    * [ ] Implement the `Autonomous Code Generator (AGK)` to forge new micro-generators.
    * [ ] Demonstrate the system's ability to solve a problem using a capability that it created for itself.
